Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
--------------------------------------

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original
works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other
rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations
are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part
of our licenses.

Creative Commons public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to
give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors
should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose
before applying it.

Creative Commons public licenses do not affect freedoms that users have under
exceptions and limitations to copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses
grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted
for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in
the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all
changes be marked or described.
